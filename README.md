# Conductor take-home DevOps exercise
## Architecture exercise
The [Go playground provides](https://play.golang.org) the ability to run code directly through the web browser. We would like you to design a backend architecture to run arbitrary code samples in any programming language, and send the results back. You can assume that there is already a frontend application capable of sending the code sample payload via WebSocket, along with the name of the programming language and its version. How would you design the architecture needed to safely execute arbitrary code in any programming language?

You may use the following diagram applications:
- AWS: [Cloudcraft](https://cloudcraft.co)
- GCP: [Cacoo](https://cacoo.com/templates/gcp-diagram-software)

Please allocate time for up to one hour to complete the exercise. You may present missing components, or changes to the architecture during the follow-up conversation. Please send your architecture document to <workwithus-engineering@conductortech.com> upon completion of the exercise.

Weâ€™re excited to see what you will come up with!
